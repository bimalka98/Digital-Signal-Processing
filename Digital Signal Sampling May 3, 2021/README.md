1. Plot of the signal y(t) = A:cos(2:pi:f:t)
2. Nyquist sampling frequency (fnq)
3. Sampled signal at Nyquist sampling frequency (fnq)
4. Sampled signal at (2fnq), (fnq) and (fnq/2)
5. Minimum number of bits (nb) required per a sample and number of minimum quantization levels (L) to have a SNqR ratio greater than 25dB
6. Quantization of Sampled output values [[code]](LaTeX%20Report/code/quantizeSample.m)
7. Quantization of the Signal sampled at 8 times Nyquist rate (8fnq) with 16 Quantization Levels
8. Quantization of the Signal sampled at 8 times Nyquist rate (8fnq) with 32 and 8 Quantization Levels
